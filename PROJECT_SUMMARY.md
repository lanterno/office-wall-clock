# Project Summary

## Wall Clock In Machine - Complete Design Document

**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Design Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Project Type**: IoT Hardware Device + Firmware  
**Purpose**: Automate office time tracking with a physical button

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

You are tired of opening your terminal every day to make curl requests to your timer API. This project solves that problem by creating a **physical desk device** with one button that automatically tracks your office time.

### The Problem
- Current process: Open terminal → Type curl command → Hit enter (15 seconds, 2x/day)
- Interrupts workflow, easy to forget, wastes time

### The Solution
- Press button when arriving at office → Device calls API automatically (2 seconds)
- Press button when leaving → Logs time and shows celebration if 8 hours completed
- **Annual time savings**: ~2.6 hours + no context switching!
