# Preparation

Before soldering or assembly, prepare tools, parts, and workspace.

## Tools
- Soldering iron + stand + wet sponge
- Lead-free solder (0.5â€“0.8 mm)
- Wire cutters / strippers
- Tweezers
- Multimeter
- Heat-shrink tubing + heat gun
- Screwdrivers (PH0/PH1)

## Parts Checklist
- ESP32-C3 DevKit
- WS2812B LED strip (8 px)
- Panel-mount button (latching)
- LiPo 3.7V 2000 mAh
- TP4056 USB-C charger

## Workspace
- Ventilated area (or fume extractor)

## Pre-flight Tests
1. Power ESP32 via USB; upload blink sketch
