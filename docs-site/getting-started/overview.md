# Overview

Welcome to the Wall Clock In Machine project! This guide will help you understand what this project is about and whether it's right for you.

## What Is This?

The Wall Clock In Machine is a **physical IoT device** that automates time tracking for office workers. Instead of typing terminal commands to start/stop your work timer, you simply press a button on your desk.

### The Problem It Solves

If you use a timer API to track your work hours, you probably do this every day:

```bash
# When arriving at office
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/timer/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "office-time"}'

# When leaving office  
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/timer/stop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"beat_id": "12345"}'
```

This process:

- ‚ùå Takes 15 seconds (twice a day)
- ‚ùå Interrupts your workflow
- ‚ùå Easy to forget
- ‚ùå Requires opening terminal
- ‚ùå Frustrating on busy days

### The Solution

With the Wall Clock In Machine:

- ‚úÖ Press button (2 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Device calls API automatically
- ‚úÖ LED feedback confirms action
- ‚úÖ Never forget - button is on your desk
- ‚úÖ Battery powered - weeks between charges

!!! success "Time Savings"
    **Daily**: 26 seconds saved  
    **Yearly**: ~2.6 hours saved  
    **Plus**: No context switching, no forgetting!

All software is free and open source!

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements

**Your Timer API Must Have**:

- ‚úÖ HTTP/HTTPS endpoint for starting timer
- ‚úÖ HTTP/HTTPS endpoint for stopping timer
- ‚úÖ JSON API (or be willing to modify firmware)
- ‚úÖ Accessible from your WiFi network

**Example API Format**:
```json
POST /api/timer/start
{
  "project_id": "office-time"
}

POST /api/timer/stop
{
  "beat_id": "12345"
}
```

!!! info "API Flexibility"
    The firmware is designed to work with the API structure shown above, but you can easily modify it to match your specific API. See [API Integration](../firmware/api-integration.md) for details.

### Knowledge Requirements

**Helpful to Know** (but not required):

- Basic electronics (what is voltage, current, ground)
- Soldering (or watch a YouTube tutorial first)
- Command line basics (cd, ls, running commands)
- ESP-IDF + Rust basics (helpful for troubleshooting)

**Don't Worry If You Don't Know**:

Our documentation explains everything step-by-step with:

- Clear instructions with photos/diagrams
- Troubleshooting for common issues
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
